**Zynq-7000 FPGA Development Board UART and I2C project**

This lab demonstrates how to integrate UART and I2C functionalities on a Zynq-7000 FPGA development board using off-the-shelf (OTF) Pmods. Specifically, we will use the Digilent Pmod TMP3 to measure ambient temperature and display the results on a serial COM terminal via UART. A demo video has been pushed to showcase the project.

Hardware used: Zybo Z7-20, TMP3 I2C Pmod, and a UART PMod

Software used: Xilinx Vivado, Xilinx Vitis
